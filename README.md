I switched from dwm to hyprland for a few days, and while I love the animations and while many things have improved significantly (namely NVIDIA support), it's still just not quite there yet. So I went back to dwm and tried to replicate my config (polybar -> dwm bar, and animations too!) and here is the result.
WM: dwm
Bar: default + dwmblocks
OS: Arch
Font: JetBrainsMono Nerd Font (terminal), Noto Sans Bold (everywhere else)
Wallpaper: [here](https://github.com/zhichaoh/catppuccin-wallpapers/blob/main/misc/cat_bunnies.png)
Terminal: Kitty
PDF Viewer: Zathura
Theme: Catppuccin!
